# Server Actions

This directory contains Next.js server actions that handle server-side logic for the application.

## Available Actions

_Currently no server actions are implemented. This directory will contain server-side logic for the application._

## Benefits of Server Actions

1. **Direct API Access**: Server actions execute on the server, providing secure access to backend APIs and resources.
2. **Type Safety**: Fully typed interfaces ensure proper data handling between client and server.
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Server actions work with or without JavaScript, improving reliability.
4. **Reduced API Routes**: Eliminates the need for separate API routes, simplifying the codebase.
5. **Simplified Error Handling**: Errors can be caught and handled directly in the component calling the action.

## Usage Guidelines

- Import server actions directly into client components.
- Use `try/catch` for proper error handling.
- Validate input data on the server using Zod schemas.
- Provide meaningful error messages to the client.
